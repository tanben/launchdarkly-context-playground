# LaunchDarkly Context Playground
The LaunchDarkly Context Playground is a tool that allows developers to easily design and validate target audiences and rollout strategies.

### Features:
NOTEÂ Only available to feature flags enabled for client-side use like web or mobile SDK.
* Evaluate flag rules and rollout strategy
* Generate a report of contexts and evaluated result

#### `Important`
It is recommended to use separate environments in your Launchardkly project for testing purposes with test data. This ensures that the test data does not get mixed up with your live production data.

## Requirements
* [LaunchDarkly account](https://launchdarkly.com/start-trial/)
* [Client Side ID](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/environments/?q=clientside+id#finding-and-resetting-an-environments-sdk-key-mobile-key-or-client-side-id)
* NodeJS >=18.x
* React 18.x


## Instalation
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies with command:

    ```


## Running the app
#### `IMPORTANT:`
> Use a sandbox Project and Environment when testing with sample data to avoid mixing sample data with live/production data.


`npm start`\
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
