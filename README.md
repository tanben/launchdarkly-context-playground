# LaunchDarkly Context Playground
Design and validate LaunchDarkly contexts for targeting and rollout strategy using this sample React.js app.

### Features:
* Test flag evaluation : targeting rules and percentage rollout with this app.
* Identify and generate a report of contexts that will be included/excluded based on target rule or percentage rollout.

Uses client-side SDK (React SDK) to make it easy to troubleshoot on the customerâ€™s environment.

#### `Important`
Create/Use a environment in your LaunchDarkly project if you will be testing with the sample data that is generated; 100 context, by this app to avoid mixing with your live data

## Requirements
* [LaunchDarkly account](https://launchdarkly.com/start-trial/)
* [Client Side ID](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/environments/?q=clientside+id#finding-and-resetting-an-environments-sdk-key-mobile-key-or-client-side-id)
